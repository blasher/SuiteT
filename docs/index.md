### Installation

I apologize, however due issues caused by discrepencies between the zip file that GitHub creates and what 
is required for installation, there is a small process that needs to be completed for installation.  I'm not
the only one with this issue as you can see an article about this in the sugar community forums at:
https://community.sugarcrm.com/thread/23464.  The
process is detailed below.


 - Download zip file by clicking the "Download .zip" button at the top of this page.
 - Uncompress the zip
 - You will notice that there is a directory wrapped around the files.
 - Go into that directory and create a new zip file with those files.  If you were to unzip this new file, there should be a manifest file in the root dir.  If it is not there, you will not be able to install.
 - Take that new zip file and upload it to your CRM instance via the module loader
